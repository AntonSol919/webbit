        <h1>An example page</h1>
        <p>
            This is an example page. There is nothing interesting here.
            Add <a href="?uploader">'uploader'</a> to the search paramter.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you see the blue bar, you should edit the destination path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next you can use the 'Edit' checkbox to edit this text, or use F12 to use the browser tools.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can do the ?uploader trick for any html page on webbit. Find a page you like and add 'uploader' to the query string to <s>steal</s> copy its design.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you're satified - press upload. You'll be taken to quarantine. Here you input/generate your identity to vouch for the content you're uploading.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can also add javascript. That sounds dangerous, but its not more dangerous than any other unkown website you find with google.
            Javascript is sandboxed to this subdomain, and there are no cookies or identities to steal from webbit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Javascript allows us to get meta. We can for instance create a forum thread with comments:<a href="/example.forum.editor.html">/example.forum.editor.html</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Think the editor needs better styling? Want to support nested comments? - just add '?uploader' and build it. (or send a POST request to the destination url ending with ?data)
